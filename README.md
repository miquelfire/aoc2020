# Miquel Fire's Advent of Code 2020

Just a repo for holding my work for Advent of Code 2020

I used a template from [Replit](https://aoc-templates.util.repl.co/) for the base code so I can run each day's parts easily.

After day 8, I'm not including my inputs. The Advent of Code's creator doesn't want his site copied easily, and the more inputs out the wild, the easier it is for someone to steal his work. Also, the site doesn't have a license to allow for reproduction anyway.
